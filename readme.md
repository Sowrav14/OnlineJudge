# OnlineJudge: A Full-Stack Competitive Programming Platform

## Overview

**OnlineJudge** is a full-stack web application inspired by platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. It enables users to solve coding problems, submit solutions in various languages (C++, Python, Java, JavaScript), and receive real-time verdicts. Designed to be scalable, secure, and real-time, the project demonstrates the practical integration of modern technologies across the software stack.

This project reflects my interest in system design, distributed computing, and full-stack engineering. Rather than reinventing existing tools, OnlineJudge explores how diverse technologies work together to build a production-ready competitive programming environment.

## System Architecture

The platform comprises four primary components:

1. **Frontend** (Next.js)
2. **Backend API** (Python)
3. **Message Queue** (RabbitMQ)
4. **Code Judge** (Docker container with isolated runtimes)

## Project Components

### 1. Frontend

- Built with **Next.js** and **ShadCN UI**.
- Includes an editor with syntax highlighting and language detection.
- Uses **NextAuth** for OAuth and manual login.

### 2. WebSocket Server

- Built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript** using `ws`.
- Delivers real-time submission updates to users.
- Listens for verdicts via **RabbitMQ** fanout exchange.

### 3. Python Worker

- Fetches submissions from RabbitMQ.
- Executes them in a Dockerized environment.
- Streams verdicts back via WebSocket.

### 4. The Judge (Docker)

- Secure, sandboxed execution using Docker-in-Docker.
- Supports C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.
- Returns verdicts like: `Accepted`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`, `Running on Test-X` etc.

## Getting Started

To run OnlineJudge locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Docker and Docker Compose**: For containerization and running various services.
* **Node.js** (with npm): For the frontend (Next.js) and WebSocket server.
* **Python**: For the Python Worker.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    First, get the project files onto your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sowrav14/OnlineJudge.git
    cd OnlineJudge
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create those `.env` files in the in place of `.env.sample` files in respective directories of the project. These files will store sensitive information and configuration settings. Populate it with the necessary variables, including database connection strings, OAuth credentials, and RabbitMQ connection details as shown there.

3.  **Build The Judge Docker Image**:
    Navigate into the `the-judge` directory and build the Docker image for our code execution environment. We'll tag it as `the-judge`.
    ```bash
    cd the-judge
    docker build -t the-judge .
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Launch All Services with Docker Compose**:
    Ensure your Docker daemon is running (e.g., Docker Desktop). From the root directory of the project, use Docker Compose to build and start all the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. This command will handle setting up PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, the Next.js frontend, the Node.js WebSocket server, and the Python Worker.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

5.  **Access OnlineJudge**:
    Once all services are up and running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
    You should now see the OnlineJudge landing page!

## My Journey, Passion & Future Enhancements

This project isn‚Äôt just another online judge ‚Äî it‚Äôs a canvas for my learning and a testament to applying technologies I've studied in a challenging, high-level project. Building OnlineJudge from the ground up has been an incredibly rewarding experience, allowing me to dive deep into a diverse set of technologies and architect a complex, real-time system.

My passion for competitive programming, coupled with a strong desire to understand the underlying mechanisms of online judges, fueled the development of this platform. I specifically chose to integrate and explore:

* **Asynchronous Systems with RabbitMQ**: Mastering message queuing and fanout exchanges for efficient task processing and real-time status updates.
* **WebSockets for Real-time Experiences**: Building a dedicated server to provide instant feedback on submission statuses.
* **Dockerization of Isolated Environments**: Crafting "The Judge" as a secure, containerized execution environment, including the advanced use of Docker-in-Docker.
* **Database Modeling with Prisma & PostgreSQL**: Designing and managing robust data structures for problems, submissions, and user information.
* **Secure Authentication Flows with NextAuth & OAuth**: Implementing flexible and secure user authentication via manual credentials, Google, and GitHub.
* **Clean & Responsive Frontend with Next.js & ShadCN UI**: Developing a modern, performant, and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

This project has solidified my understanding of how various components of a modern web application integrate and communicate to deliver a seamless user experience. It has sparked a deeper interest in:

### Future Aspirations & Enhancements

Building upon the foundation of OnlineJudge, I am enthusiastic about continuing to learn and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with web technologies. My future plans and areas of deep-dive exploration include:

* **Distributed Systems**: Further exploring concepts like fault tolerance, consistency, and partitioning in large-scale distributed environments.
* **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)**: Delving deeper into Kubernetes for managing and scaling the microservices of an online judge system, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization.
* **Performance Optimization**: Investigating advanced techniques for optimizing code execution time, memory footprint, and overall resource utilization within the judging system.
* **Security in Sandboxed Environments**: Researching more sophisticated methods for securing code execution in untrusted environments to prevent exploits and ensure system integrity.
* **AI-Assisted Feedback**: Exploring the integration of AI to provide more insightful and personalized feedback on user submissions beyond just correctness.
* **Expanded Language Support**: Adding support for more competitive programming languages like Rust and Go.
* **Caching with Redis**: Implementing Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., problem statements, common test cases) to improve performance and reduce database load.
* **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Setting up automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes.

This OnlineJudge project is just the beginning of my journey into building high-performance, resilient, and engaging software.
